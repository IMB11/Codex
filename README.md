QuickSearch/Codex/Untitled Mod allows you to gain information and do quick calculations in a Satisfactory-style codex screen.

## FAQ

***Isn't scraping Fandom Wiki's against TOS?***

I am not scraping wiki pages - I request their Open Graph tags - the description tag contains the first paragraph of the page.

More information on the Open Graph Protocol [can be found here.](https://ogp.me/)

***The Minecraft Wiki has a Share-Alike NonCommercial license! You're breaking it!***

I am not breaking it because the wiki is not being distributed with the mod. The user must provide a URL or select from preset URLs to download a pre-processed JSON file of item descriptions, and other configuration.

No wiki content is being distributed AT ALL.

***Is this an REI replacement?***

No. Although Quicksearch/Codex/Untitled Mod shows recipes - it is not a REI/EMI/whatever replacement - these mods do not provide descriptions and tips on the usage of items/blocks - and any existing implementation sucks.
It can act as an alternative though, however, recipe searching is not the primary goal of this mod.

***Where can I follow development?***
